## Analysis tests

Analysis testing means testing something during the analysis phase of Bazel
execution -- this is when rule logic is run.

See [Analysis testing](analysis_tests.md) for how to write analysis tests.

## Fluent asserts

Included in rules_testing is a fluent, truth-style asserts library.

See [Truth docs](truth.md) for how to use it.
