"""Truth-style asserts for Bazel's Starlark.

These asserts follow the Truth-style way of performing assertions. This
basically means the actual value is wrapped in a type-specific object that
provides type-specific assertion methods. This style provides several benefits:
    * A fluent API that more directly expresses the assertion
    * More egonomic assert functions
    * Error messages with more informative context
    * Promotes code reuses at the type-level.

For more detailed documentation, see the docs on GitHub.

::::{topic} Basic usage

:::{note}
This example assumes usage of [`rules_testing`]'s [`analysis_test`]
framework, but that framework is not required.

::::

```
def foo_test(env, target):
    subject = env.expect.that_target(target)
    subject.runfiles().contains_at_least(["foo.txt"])
    subject.executable().equals("bar.exe")

    subject = env.expect.that_action(...)
    subject.contains_at_least_args(...)
```
