"""StructSubject

A subject for arbitrary structs. This is most useful when wrapping an ad-hoc
struct (e.g. a struct specific to a particular function). Such ad-hoc structs
are usually just plain data objects, so they don't need special functionality
that writing a full custom subject allows. If a struct would benefit from
custom accessors or asserts, write a custom subject instead.

This subject is usually used as a helper to a more formally defined subject that
knows the shape of the struct it needs to wrap. For example, a `FooInfoSubject`
implementation might use it to handle `FooInfo.struct_with_a_couple_fields`.

Note the resulting subject object is not a direct replacement for the struct
being wrapped:
    * Structs wrapped by this subject have the attributes exposed as functions,
      not as plain attributes. This matches the other subject classes and defers
      converting an attribute to a subject unless necessary.
    * The attribute name `actual` is reserved.


## Example usages

To use it as part of a custom subject returning a sub-value, construct it using
`subjects.struct()` like so:

```starlark
load("@rules_testing//lib:truth.bzl", "subjects")

def _my_subject_foo(self):
    return subjects.struct(
        self.actual.foo,
        meta = self.meta.derive("foo()"),
        attrs = dict(a=subjects.int, b=subjects.str),
    )
```

If you're checking a struct directly in a test, then you can use
`Expect.that_struct`. You'll still have to pass the `attrs` arg so it knows how
to map the attributes to the matching subject factories.

```starlark
def _foo_test(env):
    actual = env.expect.that_struct(
        struct(a=1, b="x"),
        attrs = dict(a=subjects.int, b=subjects.str)
    )
    actual.a().equals(1)
    actual.b().equals("x")
```
